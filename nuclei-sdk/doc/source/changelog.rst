Changelog
=========

V0.3.1
------

This is official version ``0.3.1`` of Nuclei SDK.

.. caution::

    - We are using ``demosoc`` to represent the Nuclei Evaluation SoC for customer to replace the old name ``hbird``.
    - The ``hbird`` SoC is renamed to ``demosoc``, so the ``SoC/hbird`` folder is renamed to ``SoC/demosoc``,
      and the ``SoC/hbird/Board/hbird_eval`` is renamed to ``SoC/demosoc/Board/nuclei_fpga_eval``.


* SoC

    - board: Add support for TTGO T-Display-GD32, contributed by `tuupola`_
    - Add definitions for the Interface Association Descriptor of USB for GD32VF103, contributed by `michahoiting`_.
    - **IMPORTANT**: ``hbird`` SoC is renamed to ``demosoc``, and ``hbird_eval`` is renamed to ``nuclei_fpga_eval``

      - Please use ``SOC=demosoc BOARD=nuclei_fpga_eval`` to replace ``SOC=hbird BOARD=hbird_eval``
      - The changes are done to not using the name already used in opensource Hummingbird E203 SoC.
      - Now ``demosoc`` is used to represent the Nuclei Demo SoC for evaluation on Nuclei FPGA evaluation Board(MCU200T/DDR200T)

* Documentation

    - Update ``msh`` application documentation
