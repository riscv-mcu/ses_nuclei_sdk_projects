      building application software.

   ISR
      (Interrupt Service Routine) Also known as an interrupt handler, an ISR
      is a callback function whose execution is triggered by a hardware
      interrupt (or software interrupt instructions) and is used to handle
      high-priority conditions that require interrupting the current code
      executing on the processor.

   XIP
      (eXecute In Place) a method of executing programs directly from long
      term storage rather than copying it into RAM, saving writable memory for
      dynamic data and not the static program code.

   DSP
      (Digital Signal Processing) is the use of digital processing, such as by
      computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide
      variety of signal processing operations.

   NN
      (Neural Network) is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense,
      an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.
